# Project: COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python

## Overview

The goal of this guided project from coursera is to practise data preprocessing and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an analysis.
Data visualization is also a very important step in our result analysis.  


## Main steps

- Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

- Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.

- Merging two datasets and finding correlations among our data.

- Visualizing our analysis results using Seaborn.
